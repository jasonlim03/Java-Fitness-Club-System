# Java-Fitness-Club-System
The APU FITNESS-CLUB System is a comprehensive software project designed to meet the specific needs of the Asia Pacific University (APU) community. This project aims to provide a streamlined and efficient solution for the management of a fitness club within the university. It caters to staff, trainers, and students, offering them a user-friendly interface for a range of operations related to fees payment, student profiles, class schedules, and payment management.

The primary goal of the APU FITNESS-CLUB System is to replicate a fees payment system that benefits both club administrators and students. It simplifies processes related to payment, checking outstanding balances, and tracking fitness class schedules. Additionally, fitness trainers can effectively manage their students' outstanding balances and seamlessly upload class details, including class topics, charges, schedules, and instructor information. This multi-faceted system aims to enhance the efficiency and transparency of managing a fitness club while also offering a convenient experience for all users.
